Possible changes:
- Create separate module for books/header/sidebar
- page size should be changeable
- UX/style imporvements
- Folder structure could be better
- Search should contain titles only (Not available in currently used endpoint??)
- Investigate changing in response.totalItems
- Investigate issue about removing Component from router breaks opening detail from shopping cart
- Generic solution for paging (? npm package ?)
